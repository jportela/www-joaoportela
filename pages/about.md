## About

👋 I’m João, a Software Engineer currently living in Porto, Portugal. I'm passionate about well crafted experiences, that make people’s lives easier.

I'm currently enjoying a short sabbatical, while I'm between jobs. I'll be developing the web app at [FitBod](https://www.fitbod.me), an app I've been using for the past year to get healthier and stronger. I've previously developed great products at [InVisionApp](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Imaginary Cloud](https://www.imaginarycloud.com) and [Blip](https://www.blip.pt).

I've been told I go way too deep when learning and exploring my personal hobbies. I'd love to chat with you about the following:

  * 🏃‍♂️Running
  * 🥘Cooking
  * 🎹Piano
  * 🐉FC Porto
