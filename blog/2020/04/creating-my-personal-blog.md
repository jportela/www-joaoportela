This is under construction, not yet finished!

As I'm currently on a small personal development [sabbatical](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/03/18/more-on-sabbaticals/) while I'm between jobs, I've decided to start by creating a blog and revamping my personal website from scratch.

I wanted it to be simple and easily iterateable (inspired by the concept of [Incremental Correctness, by Guillermo Rauch](https://designdetails.fm/episodes/113490)) and to provide an effective way for me to communicate my ideas and to maintain a web presence.
If you are reading this now, that means it kind of did its job.

This blog posts explains how I created my website and blog, and the technical decisions that went along with it.

### Using React for a static site

My website and blogs are mostly going to be static. That means that I'm not expecting that there will be much dynamic content (generated by a server, or requested from an API).

React and Static are almost opposite in semantics. A few years ago I would have defended using plain HTML for your personal website. React is intended for highly reactive (updating fairly often) applications.
While React was built (and it's really good) at supporting that use case, its component based architecture makes it easier to reason your website into small reusable components.
React is also good at generating static HTML pages, that can be delivered right at the edge, next to the users, via a CDN. New frameworks such as [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.com)
make this setup and workflow easy, providing an accelerated development experience.

There's nothing wrong with using plain HTML/CSS/JS, or really any other tool for your personal website and blog. Just go with the tool that will better accomplish your goals, whatever they might be.

### Going with Next.js as a base framework

I've been exploring [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) lately, as the base framework for a full-featured web application. It provides interesting features out of the box, such as Universal Rendering (server side rendering using the same React components that are used in the client).
What I'm liking the most is how decoupled the framework is from your code base. It is practically unopinionated on how you structure your source code (apart from the `pages` directory, which can also be customized) and the coupling pieces are just on a few hook points (such as `getStaticProps`) and methods/components (such as `Link` or `useRouter`),
that could be abstracted away to promote easier decoupling. It also allows you to get away from webpack and build configurations (while allowing for customization), and to deploy easily (to [ZEIT](https://zeit.co)) or any other provider.
