Earlier this year I've decided on doing a sabbatical. I've been working pretty much non stop these last 8 years, since I finished college (thankfully with the occasional one-week or the rare two-week vacation), and I felt I needed time to stop and reflect. In this post I explain why I felt I needed one, and what I'm planning on doing.

### When is it time to take one?

You might have been working for a long time and feel you need the free time. In my case, I've been toying with the idea of having at least one month of uninterrupted vacation for the last two years. Four months ago it became real, though. I started to feel I was not progressing as I wanted on my career. I felt I needed a change. I think I pretty much started to feel burned out. One day, I started brainstorming and planning on what I would do if I didn't have a job. The plan got me excited, in a way that I haven't been feeling in a long time. That's when I knew I needed this to happen.

### What do people do on a sabbatical?

A sabbatical is something that's highly personal (at 45 days, I'm not even sure if mine qualifies as proper one). In my case, I've been feeling the need to improve my craft and fill some gaps on my technical knowledge, in order to be more confident on the work I do (this is fueled in part by Imposter's Syndrome, but learning can't hurt). So I've decided to structure it on four key areas:

  * Learn
  * Build
  * Grow
  * Relax

### Learn

_**Motivation**: Invest in your craft. Learn the foundations you never got to learn deeply. Be a better engineer._

I've started by brainstorming what I wanted to learn about, or what I felt I needed to get a deeper understanding on:

  * Languages:
    * Rust
    * deno
  * Frameworks:
    * nestjs
    * Vuejs
    * Polymer
    * React Native / React Native Web
    * Svelte
    * Ember
    * Flutter
  * Books:
    * Clean Coder
    * Clean Code
    * Patterns of Enterprise Architecture
    * Enterprise Integration Patterns
    * Development and Deployment of Online Multiplayer Games
  * Foundations:
    * Design Patterns
    * Cloud Patterns
    * Ethical OS
  * Testing Frameworks:
    * Cypress
    * Loki
    * React Testing Library
  * Frontend:
    * Analytics
    * Cloudflare Workers
    * CDN / Edge
    * CSS Layout (Flexbox and Grid)
    * Headless CMS
    * Feature Flags
  * Infrastructure:
    * Terraform
    * GoCD
    * GCP
  * Tools:
    * VS Code
    * iTerm
    * Notion
    * Todoist
    * Mail

I probably won't have the time to cover everything that's on the list, but that's fine, it's a starting point that I'll need to prioritize.

### Build

_**Motivation**: Create. Build your portfolio and online presence. Explore your side projects. Make yourself known for what you build._

I like building. That's why I love being a software engineer. Revamping my personal website and starting this blog is already a step on that direction. I also have plans to actively contribute to open-source and work on a product that I've been meaning to create for sometime now (if all goes well, I'll share it with you here soon).

### Grow

_**Motivation:** Explore other interests. Get better on every day things._

These are things that make me happy on my daily life, and that I want to explore more or get better at. I might write about these in here, occasionally:

  * Cooking (I'm getting better at it, but there's still a lot I need to learn/practice)
  * Piano (I've stopped learning/playing and I want it to be part of my life again)
  * Parenting (not a parent yet, but preparing to be one)
  * Fitness (focused on distance running and general health)

I also have other two that I've given lower priority:
  * Japanese (I had a few lessons a long time ago)
  * Drawing (I'm terrible at it. I want to get better)

### Relax

_**Motivation:** This one is pretty much self motivating._

Play games (currently playing Final Fantasy VII Remake). Watch TV. Read. Go through a Wikipedia rabbit-hole for two hours. Have fun.
